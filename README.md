This artifact, associated with the paper *"Studying and Improving the Soundness of Feature-Based Debloating,"* includes the following repositories:

1. [fuzzing-deb-with-sanitizers](https://github.com/the-Soundness-of-Debloating/fuzzing-deb-with-sanitizers): This repository supports the execution of symcc, afl++, and radasma, providing scripts for running these tools, raw data on soundness issues (pre-deduplication), and scripts for analyzing, validating, and deduplicating results.

2. [deb-soundnessIssue](https://github.com/the-Soundness-of-Debloating/deb-soundnessIssue): This repository logs the deduplicated results from the fuzzing tools and includes analysis scripts.

3. [deb-soundnessIssue-distribution-chart](https://github.com/the-Soundness-of-Debloating/deb-soundnessIssue-distribution-chart): This repository includes scripts for generating distribution charts of soundness issues.

4. [debloating_analysis_tools](https://github.com/the-Soundness-of-Debloating/debloating_analysis_tools): This repository provides a tool for augmenting debloated programs.

5. [covexitaug_evaluation](https://github.com/the-Soundness-of-Debloating/covexitaug_evaluation): This repository covers the generality evaluation of CovExitAug.

In summary, the first three repositories are part of the study section, while the last two focus on the CovExitAug tool.
